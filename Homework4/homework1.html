                Hello! My name is Max Rocans, and I’m a personal trainer by profession. I’ve been in the fitness industry for over 20 years, 
                working with clients of all backgrounds to help them achieve their health and fitness goals. I’m taking this course as a way to further 
                my understanding of computer languages, which I find both fun and challenging.
                <br><br>
                I graduated from San Jose State University with a degree in Marketing many years ago, and after focusing on my fitness career, I decided 
                to dive back into learning something new. Outside of work, I’m a husband and father to an energetic 3-year-old daughter who keeps me on my toes!
                <br><br>
                In my free time, I participate in fitness events such as 10Ks, half-marathons, and Spartan races. I’ve also taken part in bodybuilding competitions, 
                and I’ve helped some of my clients do the same.
